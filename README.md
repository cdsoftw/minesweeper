# Minesweeper
This repo contains an ASCII-based version of Minesweeper written in C++ for my Computer Science I class at the University of North Texas. This was the first major project I created in any language, and was written when I had about 4 months of programming experience. Because of this, the design and implementation is rather basic, but I'm still quite proud of it.

This project was designed to be executed in a Unix-based environment with the C++ GNU compiler.
